## Project Description
Madrid is the capital city of Spain, located right in the centre of the Iberian Peninsula. Its geographical location grants good communications of the city with other Spanish regions. As capital of the country, it is the seat to the Spanish government institutions and the city of residence of Spanish Royal family.
Due to Madrid's high altitude of 650 metres, it experiences quite different temperatures in the summer and the winter. The most pleasant warm weather falls between May and mid July when average temperatures are between 20 and 32 degrees Celsius. Towards the end of July, and throughout August, it can get hot with temperatures sometimes reaching 40 degrees Celsius. Night-time temperatures remain around 18 degrees Celsius. However, the climate in Madrid is low in humidity, therefore making the high temperatures easier to tolerate.
September is a pleasant month, with temperatures back down to around 25 degrees Celsius. October is also still fairly warm with an average daytime temperature of 20 degrees Celsius.
The weather in Madrid is predominantly dry, but that doesn't mean that rain can be ruled out. Especially in the winter months.
In this project a detailed study to different aspects of weather in Madrid were studied and expressive charts were made. The relationship between the different parameters and how they affect the weather is explained.


## Questions & Hypotheses
As written before, an overview of the weather in Madrid between 1997 and 2015 will be shown with the help of expressive charts. The realationshi between the different paramaeters will be explained and in some cases a predictive chart of 2016 might be generated based on the historical data being processed.


## Dataset
To start the analysis a dataset from Kaggle was studied.

## Workflow
The workflow was as follows:
1. Cleaning the dataset
2. Exporting it to a csv file
3. Using the dataset as a data source in Tableau
4. running analysis on the different paramaeters and explaining the relationship among them, incl. use of plots
5. Preparing presentation based on the insights (Tableau Story)
6. Finalizing folder and file structure


## Organization
For gathering possible data sources an intesive online research was conducted and in the end the previously mentioned dataset from Kaggle.com was chosen.

The repository is set up as follows:


### Output folder:

### Subfolder with following content:
##### 1. Data cleaner: 

The dataset from www.kaggle.com with  the name "weather_madrid_LEMD_1997_2015"
exported as "Weather_Madrid_clean" after cleaning
